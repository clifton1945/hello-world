I am trying to guess what kind of containers to use for what:
    Dictionaries || Lists ?
    The D:DOM IS A hierarchical Dict | Tree: a Dict
        Text|Document|Scriptures|Book|Chapter|Verse....
    A L: | Space: Space|PointOfView|Category|View IS a Distinguishing Set of Elements  based on some criteria/function
        Read.pst, ,cur, .fut: what I started with
    A D: || E: DOM Element HAS A Style Obj/Dict
        a Verse in the current thinking
    The D:Stytle Object HAS Properties: each IS A Dict,
    A HTML element therefore has A styleObj WITH many CssStyleDeclaration: Dicts

I am trying to guess what kind of functions to use for what:
    Thus DOM Element selection IS TO Dict
    Thus Element Context selection IS TO a List
    Thus Element Style selection IS TO a Dict/jsObj

Broadly, I want to
    STEP1. define a Distinguishing Element selection Criteria function:
            currently: Reading. pst. cur, fut
    STEP2. accumulate elements into n>1 Sets of Elements
    STEP3. Apply Style transformations to each Element.style object as a function of it Category AND its CONTEXT within the Category:

     NOTE: transformation function parameters are
        (1) its space|category AND
        (2) its CONTEXT within that context: index and siblings*.
            * needing sibling Count forces the use of traversing the Document to segregate sub Sets /Lists
             rather than a one pass over the entire

    today This firms up my vacillating tween Rclass Lists OR on-the-fly assigning which Rclss: pst, cur, fut
      So (STEP1) use my existing three isPst, isCur, isFut
      and (STEP2) use R.filter -> 3 sets
      and (STEP3) indexMap and evolve and transform each element in each set.
        start with opacity and fontSize CSDs
        transform as f(ndx, sbls) -> Scaler|Wter constant
