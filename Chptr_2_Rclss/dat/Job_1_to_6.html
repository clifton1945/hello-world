                            perfect and upright, and
                            one that feared God, and eschewed evil.

                    <div class="fut">

                        <div class='verse'>2 And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.</div>

                        <div class='verse'>3 His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and
                            five hundred yoke of
                            oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the
                            greatest of
                            all the men
                            of the east.
                        </div>

                        <div class='verse'>4 And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent
                            and called for their
                            three
                            sisters to eat and to drink with them.
                        </div>

                        <div class='verse'>5 And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job
                            sent and sanctified them,
                            and
                            rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them
                            all: for
                            Job
                            said,
                            It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job
                            continually.
                        </div>

                        <div class='verse'>6 Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before
                            the LORD, and Satan came
                            also
                            among them.
                        </div>

                        <div class='verse'>7 And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the
                            LORD, and said, From
                            going
                            to
                            and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.
                        </div>

                        <div class='verse'>8 And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that
                            there is none like him in
                            the-->
                            earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?
                        </div>

                        <div class='verse'>9 Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?
                        </div>

                        <div class='verse'>10 Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all
                            that he hath on every
                            side?
                            thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.
                        </div>

                        <div class='verse'>11 But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will
                            curse thee to thy face.
                        </div>

                        <div class='verse'>12 And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power;
                            only upon himself put
                            not
                            forth
                            thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.
                        </div>

                        <div class='verse'>13 And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and
                            drinking wine in their eldest
                            brother's house:
                        </div>

                        <div class='verse'>14 And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and
                            the asses feeding beside
                            them:
                        </div>

                        <div class='verse'>15 And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain
                            the servants with the
                            edge
                            of
                            the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
                        </div>

                        <div class='verse'>16 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of
                            God is fallen from
                            heaven,
                            and
                            hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone
                            to tell
                            thee.
                        </div>

                        <div class='verse'>17 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The
                            Chaldeans made out three bands,
                            and
                            fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge
                            of the
                            sword;
                            and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
                        </div>

                        <div class='verse'>18 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and
                            thy daughters were
                            eating
                            and
                            drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:
                        </div>

                        <div class='verse'>19 And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the
                            four corners of the house,
                            and it
                            fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
                        </div>

                        <div class='verse'>20 Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down
                            upon the ground, and
                            worshipped,
                        </div>

                        <div class='verse'>21 And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return

                        </div>

                        <div class='verse'>22 In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.

                        </div>

                        <div class='verse'>4 And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a
                            man hath will he give for his
                            life.

                        <div class='verse'>5 But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he
                            will curse thee to thy

                        <div class='verse'>6 And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his

                        </div>

                        <div class='verse'>7 So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with
                            sore boils from the sole of
                            his foot unto his crown.

                        <div class='verse'>8 And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down

                        <div class='verse'>9 Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity?

                        <div class='verse'>10 But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women
                            speaketh. What? shall we receive
                            good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with
                            his
                            lips.

                        <div class='verse'>11 Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon
                            him, they came every one
                            from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the
                            Naamathite: for
                            they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.
                        </div>

                        <div class='verse'>12 And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they
                            lifted up their voice, and
                            wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward
                            heaven.
                        </div>

                        <div class='verse'>13 So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights,
